1086940,"You are reading this, because you heard of the Game, but you can't just go for it. You heard how awesome it is, but you are still undecided, whether it is something for YOU - because of Turn-based Combat, Character Build planning, DnD mechanics, etc.
Allow me to advise you.

(Very briefly about me: I am a very experienced gamer for more than 2 decades. And I put so many hours and multiple differently aligned playthroughs into this game that I think I've seen most of it.)

Let me address first, what I expect to be the most common concerns:
Game Mechanics & Character Builds.
[tl;dr: Depending on difficulty. Play on normal and you can get around with the lightweight RPG experience. Tactician or Honor and you really have to tinker.]
No way around it. The Game uses DnD mechanics and the choices of classes of your characters are important. Very important. The differences between ""just putting any character together without much thought"" and ""thoroughly theorycrafting"" are *[i]immense[/i]*. You can piece together parties that trivialize the hardest fights, while unlucky picks in character building make you leave even ordinary encounters with sweaty palms and blood pumping in your ears.
In BG3, Character Builds and Class choices are way more vast, flexible and absolutely more influential than in most modern RPGs.
Luckily the game has multiple difficulty levels and is fairly forgiving on lower ones. Below Tactician can you get away with making only the basic RPG work. Just pick a Class for your characters, you think the archetype sounds cool, Mono-Class it all the way and every now and then check newly acquired gear.
And please don't feel bad about playing on a low difficulty. There is nothing wrong with this. It is just a question of your personal taste and what you want out of the game. In the end, it is a game, and you play it for fun. If fun means for you to have challenging tactical combat and you enjoy turn-based strategy, fine, go difficult. If you just want to enjoy an amazing fantasy world, story and a rather lightweight RPG experience without investing too much into the system, just as fine, go lower difficulty.
Most important is that you have fun. This game can serve you well and provides means to tailor it to your preference.
(And just to have it said: Character-Builds aren't fixed. You can respec easily anytime.)

The spell-casting system probably deserves explicit mentioning.
The number of spells in the game is tremendous. Some are essential, some are alright, some are outright encounter-winners on their own, some are complete utter garbage. So when wanting to build a Wizard or Sorcerer, acquiring some basic knowledge may benefit you.

Next up: Turn-based Combat.
Yeah, well, can't help you with that. You have to like it or even be open to it. That's just how it is. Strict turn-based combat. I, personally, love this genre anyway. What I found very great, is how - again - proper character builds influence this. BG3 combat (as is DnD in general) is primarily a game of resource management: ""Action Economy"". You have a limited number of actions, spells, movement, etc. And so has the enemy. You have to utilize your's better then your opponents do. You've got means to increase the amount of actions, you have; or to decrease the enemies'. It's such an entertaining puzzle, you can approach from various angles: Prepare your party well, position yourself before combat starts, or just be a smart tactician.

I think, these are the only things to raise concerns. And truly, and as much as I worship this game, you have to decide for yourself. Not everything is for everyone. If you are totally opposed to turn-based combat or do not want to tinker with puzzling character's abilities together and managing inventory [i]at all[/i], then this might indeed not be the game for you. If you can get at least some enjoyment out of these, and appreciate an otherwise masterfully crafted piece of art, I cannot recommend Baldur's Gate 3 strong enough.

What you will get definitively out of it:
• An overall marvelous high-fantasy experience
• A captivating story, with twists, and gradual reveals. It starts nebulous with you in the middle, unfolds over subsequent stages and leads to a colossal finale. The main story is absolutely worth playing.
• High-value optional side-content. There is a lot of optional content. Story Arcs for companions, alternate villains, side-quests, hidden quests wrapped into other quests leading to different outcomes and more.
• A beautiful and detailed world.
• Worthwhile quests. Every single quest is thoughtfully crafted. Not a single mindless MMO-alike fetch quest. (By-the-way, this also means that you have to be attentive to be able to solve quests. Quests aren't a numb trigger for mind-numbingly slashing some demons at a map-marker, but a little story in themselves.)
• Different solution approaches. Pretty much every single thing allows different ways to solve it. Traversal, getting behind a wall or locked door, encounter by combat or dialogue check, different solutions to quests. Spells, shapeshifting, Mage Hand, Skill-Check, Combat, exploration, stacking crates, ...
• Boss fights are very fun. (I recommend playing on Honor-Mode - or at least the Honor-ruleset on custom difficulty - already for them. They are so much more entertaining with extended abilities, tactics and Legendary Actions.)
• Probably the most impressive thing for last: The Characters. Plenty of Companions, you can recruit, other Camp Followers to gather. For every person, there will be at least one companion to adore, likely more to like. Others, you maybe wouldn't want as a friend in real life, but certainly entertaining to have around in a video game. They are all well fleshed out and most can show significant character development. And they have their own character arcs along to way to pursuit a personal goal.
You think, you are the main character. You can even create your own custom character, and the world treats you as you are the leader and main character. But that's only an immersive tool. Narratively, actually, your companions are the main characters. And that is good. Your companions weave into the world and main story and the entirety of everything makes up one broad, well-crafted, coherent adventure.",1,0,0,1760339406,36687,steam,you are reading this because you

Combat is repetitive in the extreme. Every encounter, from trash mobs to bosses, is played in the same way:

Roll
Roll
Poke
Roll
Roll
Poke
Repeat

Block
Counter
Block
Counter
Crit
Repeat

...and so on. (Fill in whatever combat loop your character is built around.)

This might be endurable if it was a tenth as long as it is, but this is a prime example of quantity over quality. Doing this for 200+ hours is not fun. 

Speaking of quantity over quality, this is one of the worst executions of an open world I've seen. There is simply no point in the open world parts of the game. The content you encounter is weak and repetitive. The mini dungeons you find are a dime a dozen. Boring, cookie cutter caves, mostly. Everything is designed to maximize a pointless grind that is utterly hostile to your time.

The legacy dungeons are the only part of the game I enjoyed, but they are so diluted by the open world content as to not be worth it, overall. If they cut out the open world and just had the legacy dungeons, the game would be an endurable length, and drastically higher quality.

On a positive note, some of the visual designs of the bosses is incredible. Truly remarkable.

1245620,"After 370 hours in Elden Ring, I can confidently say this is one of the most rewarding, frustrating, awe-inspiring, and occasionally infuriating experiences I’ve ever had in gaming.

FromSoftware took the essence of Dark Souls and dropped it into an open world that actually feels alive — not because of bustling towns or endless NPC chatter, but because every hill, ruin, and eerie tree seems to have a story behind it. The world design is immaculate. You’ll constantly find yourself saying, “Wait, what’s that over there?” and then three hours later, you’re deep in a cave fighting something that shouldn’t exist.

Combat is as tight and deliberate as ever. Every weapon feels distinct, every boss a puzzle. The difficulty curve can be brutal, but fair — most of the time. Some late-game areas (looking at you, Haligtree) cross the line between challenging and exhausting. Still, the sense of achievement when you finally overcome those fights is unmatched.

Visually, the game is stunning. The art direction carries everything, even if the technical side occasionally stumbles (stutters, pop-ins, etc.). The soundtrack deserves its own praise — haunting, epic, and perfectly timed.

Criticisms? Sure. The open world, for all its brilliance, loses a bit of momentum in the second half. Enemy variety dips, and a few recycled bosses show up too often. The NPC questlines remain as obscure as ever — sometimes charmingly mysterious, sometimes just badly explained. And inventory management is still peak FromSoftware chaos.

But despite those flaws, Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It rewards curiosity, patience, and persistence like few other games. Every hour I spent — from the first miserable death in Limgrave to the final triumphant swing against the Elden Beast — felt meaningful.

If you’re willing to be humbled, amazed, and occasionally broken, this game will give you an experience you’ll never forget.

1145360,"It took a while to click for me, because I usually am not into hack and slash type of games, but I'm very glad it did. This is definitely one of the top roguelikes out there. They absolutely nailed the Greek mythology theme here which gives it its own personality and sets it apart from other games in the genre. The collection of voiced NPCs, each with an insane amount of dialogue really make the game feel alive.

As for the gameplay, it feels tight to play and there is enough variety in the available powerups as well as the unlockables that each run feels fresh. Apart from the unlocks that you pay for with currencies, there is also a meta progression where new stuff will simply show up from time to time unexpectedly (similar to Isaac). These can range from new room types, bosses, gameplay systems or NPCs that give powerful rewards when you encounter them. This way of slowly drip feeding you new content makes the game even more addictive.

Finally the artstyle and sound direction are top notch, and the music ties very well into the Greek theme. My only complaint here is that the delivery of some the main character's voice lines can be a bit dry sometimes.

292030,"I just watched a 150 hour movie. No wait, I was IN it. Role of a lifetime. Not a spare line of dialogue, not one actor who didn't put in a career-defining performance. Even had a hand in the script. Did all my own stunts. Got the grizzled, monosyllables down pat. My hmphs and deadpan one-liners were, if I do say so myself, iconic. The highs were intoxicating and the lows, were I not method acting an emotionally crippled mutant would have been very low indeed. I've played thousands of games, always behind the camera, observing in desultory fashion. Invested, sure, but only like a football fan living vicariously through a team-based extension of the ego. This was different. Night after night I drew those swords and mixed those potions, never anything less than a Witcher, embroiled in the salt-rimed world of the Nordling, war-torn rural backwater or big-city cauldron of courtly intrigue and political drama. Not once did I think about the mundane life and the superficial world, turning quietly in the background. Just the seamless flow of destiny and the sense of having a sort of desperate, culpable influence in it. Just the solid intuition of a story moving relentlessly, irresistibly towards its climax. No mindless grinding, no consequence-free decisions. Just beauty and truth wrapped in a building, layered series of outcomes. I'm glad it's over, I'm sad it's over. This will drain you, it will stay with you long after the curtain falls, when you realise the theatre is empty and numbly shuffle to the auditorium and the long walk home. You're spent now, exhausted by the sheer amount of yourself you put into the part. But tomorrow, or next week or in a year, you'll want to go back.

292030,"[b]Strong Recommendation[/b]

Like its predecessors, The Witcher 3 is an RPG set in a dark fantasy world inspired by the works of Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. 

Unlike its predecessors though, which opted for a more constrained approach to world design, the third instalment in the series instead opts for an expansive open world -- with all the good and ill that entails.

Fittingly, while the enormous -- and quite frankly bloated -- world of The Witcher 3 is one of the game’s standout features, it’s also far and away its biggest flaw. It’s far too big, far too cluttered with mostly banal points of interest, and filled with far too many forgettable sidequests (all traits it shares in common with open-world RPGs in general). Frankly, you could’ve halved the size of the Velen/Novigrad map and very little of value would’ve been lost.

In terms of other game elements, though: the combat is solid, but takes far too long to unlock the skills needed to become interesting. 
The story is equally solid, with some excellent writing, but almost completely falls apart in the third act. Finally, the progression systems are good, with plentiful options and build ideas to be had, but skill points come far too sparsely beyond the White Orchard and even all with the skill slots unlocked the amount of skills you can use at any given time still feels agonizingly restricted.

Finally, I feel I should also spare a paragraph or two to talk about Blood and Wine, considering how vaunted it is as a DLC. In short: it’s fine. The added character building mechanics are an especially welcome addition, but after the mammoth undertaking that is the base game’s campaign, I feel they come far, far too late to truly be of value. In virtually all other respects, the expansion is simply more The Witcher 3 -- neither better nor worse than the content that came before it. Just more. 

And for fans of open-world RPGs, “more Witcher 3” will be just what the doctor ordered. For everyone else, though, the whole “comes too late to truly be appreciated” criticism I made earlier will likely very much shape how you feel about the expansion as a whole: no matter how good it may or may not be, after spending 100+ hours in the game already you’ll likely be so exhausted that it’ll be very difficult to muster up the enthusiasm to sink even more time into it without taking a lengthy break first.

In conclusion: The Witcher 3 is an overall excellent open-world RPG -- and despite its open world conventions grating on me, it’s nevertheless an RPG I still had plenty of fun playing despite its copious filler. I likely won’t have the appetite for another RPG for at least a year after this, though.

1940340,"So, DD2. The game's kinda bad. At least the main gamemode, Confessions. 

Confessions is generally not super good, since it's run structure is extremely repetetive with barely any change to differentiate between runs. You build a team, then stay with that team for 2-3h. During the run, your playstyle barely changes, meaning you'll likely feel that every fight just feels the same, with pretty much every hero having a designated ""opener button"" which you will press on the first turn for 90% of fights. The entire team also just functions the same at the start of the run and the end of the run, since mastery often just upgrades your numbers and Trinkets don't do enough to change your playstyle. This means a team at the Crossroads will just have less numbers, but the same playstyle as a Mountain-ready team after 3h of playtime. All of this results in a very repetetive grindfest that feels unbelievably similar to the last run. 

The meta progression also isn't very good. Not being able to see what you actually unlock is probably my main gripe, since you cannot see which skills you will unlock down the line, only leaving you to see the first 5 skills you start with. The same applies to Trinkets/Paths/Stagecoach gear etc etc. This is a really bad feeling, since you basically have to watch a starting guide somewhere, since without a good start getting more candles quicker will be more difficult, mainly bc you don't have the good unlocks to get good runs, which give more meta progression. This is on top of some unlockable Trinkets and items being extremely bad, cluttering the pool from allowing you to find your actually good Trinkets. 

The game also runs into it's predecessors issue of not telling you shit. Some mechanics aren't explained, the glossary doesn't update when the token in question changes it's effects and the tutorials are one long textwall you have to read through, often even with outdated screenshots. This wouldn't be a big issue, but losing a run 2h deep to a mechanic the game never tells you about just feels extremely bad. 

The Boss design is also baffling. Some Bosses basically need specific things to beat, which you have to build around. The issue? Well, you have to bring those things at THE START OF THE RUN WITH NO INDICATION DURING THE RUN YOU NEED THOSE THINGS. This often leads you to just not having the correct team to beat a boss, which means 2-3h of playtime down the drain. 
Another issue is that the Bosses have ""Dark-Souls Boss design"", aka you need to make mistakes, learn from those mistakes and then build your team better for that specific boss until you figure out the way to counter them. In Dark Souls, that's the attack patterns and dodge timing, in DD2, that's teambuilding and Items. Small issue, the walkway to try again at the boss is 2-3h long. This leads to an unecessary amount of waitng to try again at a boss, only to see that your planned strategy actually doesn't counter the boss and you losing all that progress. This just means you should look up a Boss guide, since otherwise you'll be wasting loads of time trial-and-erroring at the Boss. 

The main system of the game is also extremely snowbally. Relationships tend to win you the run by generating an insane amount of recovery/tokens, but can also do the same in the negative sense, losing you the run with crippling +Stress or negative tokens. This means you either know what you are doing, get good relationships early and cruise through the run, or struggle early and get clapped by half your skills generating Blind suddenly. If you get the hang of it, it feels great, but to get the hang of it, you need to get gud first, which is very difficult with the negative relationships.

There is some good stuff though. 

The path system essentially gives each hero 4 playstyles, which allows for some creative teambuilding. Of course, not all 4 paths are made equal, but a lot of the fun is taking a bad path/playstyle, building around it and then trying to make it work. This CAN be fun, but heavily depends on what you like doing. I personally like running these weird, off-meta comps, but that's not everybody's cup of tea. 

The token system tends to be more reliable than DD1's pure numbers. Being able to plan ahead like in DD2 is a really cool way of allowing people to express skill, instead of just being bailed out by a random dodge. There IS still RNG, but it's much less overbearing than in the first game. 

Kingdoms. If you noticed, all my negative stuff was only really applicable to Confessions. Kingdoms doesn't have meta-progression and while it does take longer, the final Bosses aren't an all-in fight like in Confessions. You actually get multiple tries to learn the Bosses' mechanics within one run, which is really nice. The Trinkets are still a bit hit or miss, but since you can keep them out of the drop pool by putting them into Inn storages, you can usually get something good. It also allowing much more access to a shop to specifically buy the good stuff, since then the cluttered garbage can just get ignored and you can just get to the good stuff. The relationships are still very snowbally, but being able to just ignore a really bad relationship by swapping that hero out mid-run for a new one, then getting that hero back after you have items to fix that bad relationship also makes it much easier to avoid snowballing into 4 bad relationship on an unplayable team. 
The one gripe about Kingdoms will always be it's extremely steep learning curve. Since you HAVE to manage your resources well from the start, you could just waste a bunch of important materials on upgrades you don't need, which leads to a worse midgame, which leads to an even worse lategame. This and essentially having 8-12 heroes at your disposal at the same time basically means you have to have some experience with all of them to have a shot at actually winning the run. Outside of that, Kingdoms is a really really good mode. 

Now, in conclusion, should you buy DD2? Well, not really unless you are willing to grind Confessions until you have learned most of the heroes to swap to the actually good Kingdoms mode, which will take a LOT of hours to fully unlock each hero to learn them. The other option is to watch someone who has experience in the game, learning from them without actually playing the game and then immediately jumping into Kingdoms. If the devs deleted confessions and instead made a tutorial kingdoms module that allowed you to experiment a bit with all of the heroes, this would easily be a positive review, but with the bad gamemode dragging down the learning experience with insane amounts of grinding and unrewarding boss design, attached to the good gamemode essentially being skill-locked with it's overwhelming amount of learning needed, it just ends up being a negative review.",0,1,0,1760319551,25636,steam,so dd2. the games kinda bad. at least the main gamemode confessions. confessions is generally not super good

1940340,"I initially sailed the seven seas to try this game out and the first impression I got from 1.0 was not great. The game felt incredibly slow, the combats felt artificially extended, and it was such a departure from the first game that it drove me away for a good couple years. It really felt like this game needed longer in the oven. But coming back after multiple free updates from the developers, I can confidently say that I enjoyed this game so much that I decided to purchase it. 

This game is VERY different from the original Darkest Dungeon. It is more in line with a traditional rogue-like where you are meant to try, fail, and try again, slowly unlocking new items, hero abilities, and upgrades. While this initially didn't seem like a great selling point to me, the more I unlocked new things, the more I wanted to experiment with the new things I unlocked. I wouldn't say it's an amazing progression system, the progression comes maybe a little too slowly for my tastes, but it did succeed in getting me excited to continue playing the game. And the more I played the game, the more I enjoyed the aspects that make this game different from the first. 

Combat has become less of a scramble of salvaging a bad situation and more solving a puzzle to lose the least amount of health. The token system has taken a lot of the frustrating randomness out of the game and honestly makes the hero compositions you bring a lot more interesting and interactive.

I was pleasantly surprised to see one of my biggest issues with the game from 1.0 was addressed in later updates, where the driving and combat didn't really seem respectful of your time. It seemed a bit backwards to want players to have a repeating gameplay loop, while wasting a lot of your time through driving and slow paced combat. There are now options to turn on Fast Driving and Fast Combat (which should be on by default) to speed up the process, there's better clarification for the tokens gained in combat, and more hero reworks are on the way with free updates.

Would I pick up this game for full price? Honestly, I'm a bit torn. Having one of the most beloved characters from the first game behind a paywall on top of the $40 price tag was an ""interesting"" decision to say the least. Having progression be locked behind failing can make it a frustrating experience for a lot of players. But I do want to believe that these developers truly care about the game that they are making and the changes they make to it. The music and art direction are absolutely top notch, the enemies and new additions to the cast are all great, and we can't forget the narrator (rest in peace).

1940340,"Im a big fan of the first game and spent many hours playing it on switch. i waited until all the dlc was out for this one and when it went on sale i bought it.

plenty of fun at first but as the time went on it became less so. why?
one of the key components of dd1 was being specific about what you wanted to do and building a team around that focus. picking certain characters not just based off abilities but also quirks and kitting them out with trinkets most suited for the job was fun. it gave a certain level of control over the environment. it didnt always work, but at least in theory it should have, you cant always avoid a double crit and then a hero dying to bleed next turn.

the control is gone in darkest dungeon 2 along with the characters and after a while, the fun.

trinkets once unlocked are put into a pool in that specific run. there is no guarantee you will even find them to use. same with useful combat and inn items, random pool = less control, less planning, less strategy, less fun.

characters are not necessarily permanent. if there is quirk you dont like on a character you cant just re roll, you have to do a run, die and/or beat the boss to get a new quirk roll. beating a boss with any character makes them permanent, at least their quirks are anyway, until they die, then they re roll again with new quirks. building a character with ease is gone.

the relationship system is a good idea but too heavily weighted. so much so that i really only use the first torch and the dog pet to enhance it as much as possible. this really limits your choices and i dont like that. the encounters can change relationships as well and i just find this really tedious, in particular when you arrive at an assistance encounter, why should there be a negative hit to relationships at a node that is meant to aid you? i mean i get it, but its just not fun.

setting up at the inn is repetitive and boring, there is no variety really, trinkets you can buy there are mostly useless or at least not really impactful. you basically buff to increase health, a status resist if you manage and spend money on relationship items and thats usually it for me, and thats pretty much every single inn.

after a while it just stops being fun. i remember in dd1 taking a crusader off the stagecoach simply because he had the hippocratic quirk (boosts healing abilities) and had fun levelling up and building that character from level 0. spending time and money on locking in quirks, removing negative ones, searching for specific trinkets for him, planning teams and runs around him etc. this for me was fun, when he died it meant something. i had invested in him. when the characters die in dd2 they just re roll. in the beginning i just pushed my team until death several times to keep learning the mechanics and gaining experience etc because their deaths literally did not matter. Now if i did want to keep a character from that run i would have to beat a boss, its the only way. if you withdraw or die you lose that character. and again i get it, the game is designed with 'making the best of a bad situation' in mind, but i play games for fun and this is just not fun anymore.",0,1,0,1760017838,3419,steam,im a big fan of the first game and spent many hours playing it on switch.

1940340,"genuinely great game but uh.

You know it's kinda fucked up to give the player an accessible list of all the status effects and what they do at any given time just because of how fucking many there are. Only to have the player find out that there are way way more status effects than that which you can't figure out what they do until they occur to you.

I'd understand if this was to make it so some encounters are passable only once you understand the mechanics, but also there isn't a bestiary or notepad or glossary or anything to help the player out. If I stop playing for a few days, come back. I'm not going to remember what ""x"" boss or enemy does with ""x"" status effect, and when it's probably one of the most important pieces of information in the game it feels bad. What sucks is that I did play this almost 6 hours straight when I first got it, only to have schoolwork to get through for about a week and now every time I try to play this game it's just impossible. I'm not going to put up with googling everything just to play your game, it's not really worth it. I love the art direction, I love the way the party system works, the progression system and the way the game approaches story telling through it's unique combination of gameplay and narrative. It's got music that feeds the aesthetic and proper sound design... Just you couldn't bother to have a simple way to let the player know what base necessary mechanics are? You can even obscure it by making you required to have an encounter initially with the status effect before being given the information on hand, but instead I just have to remember the exact details of what that one book burning boss does and whether I needed to shuffle my party to attack the books or the burner. Same with that old man in the tree roots. I don't fucking remember how he worked. I'm not about to go through 3 hours of repeating multiple runs to figure it out again because something something repetition the definition of insanity, plus it's not fun to repeat something you've already done when the only issue is that you just didn't remember what it was you exactly did last time. I'm not keeping a dedicated notebook for darkest dungeon 2 when it's 2025. My notebook is for old first person dungeon crawlers that were literally unable to create maps for their dungeons and drawing them was half the game.

Played most of the time from epic games launcher, playtime is around 200-600 hrs.
Heroes path system is interesting - you can play same characters with different roles. There are several new heroes, which were not introduced in DD1, but some heroes from DD1 will NOT be introduced here (will not spoil which ones).

Soundtrack is more mature in comparison with DD1. My favorites:
- main theme - gorgeous,
- road music, which sets the mood for reflection,
- ""altar of hope"" music slowly but surely brings you hope as you progress,
- ""Battle of the Mountain"" in the first chorus makes the blood boil (approximately at 1:50).

A lot of runs failed, a lot of heroes died, a lot of ""ideal"" builds with strong quirks were crushed. There is a learning curve, but nothing you can't beat in time. Try again and again, with new tactics, until succeed.

1940340,"Читаю отзывы и поражаюсь. Люди пишут что первая часть была лучше, а вторая сложнее/душнее. Второй ДД немного другая игра с новыми правилами, к которым нужно привыкнуть. Вы же первой части тоже не с нулевой боссов переезжали. Какой смысл был делать игру с тем же геймплеем и новыми противниками?
Если коротко по игре, то главный совет - не читать гайды. Хотя бы первые несколько траев боссов. В целом все боссы не сложные, нужно только понять как их убивать и как подстраивать под это свою команду. Креативить и менять билды на ходу заезда очень весело. Еще веселее догадываться до того, как убить босса и пройти его самому. А самый топ это когда во время боя сначала огребаешь, потом понимаешь что игра от тебя хочешь, тут же придумываешь тактику и побеждаешь. С гайдами так не кайфануть.
В целом, игра очень хочет чтобы вы относились к своим героям как к личностям, а не пушечному мясу из первой части. Для этого есть воспоминания и дружба. Механику игры изменили и сделали ЗНАЧИТЕЛЬНО более предсказуемой. То есть ваши действия чаще всего идут по плану. Повлиять нельзя буквально на десдор и маршрут карты. К середине игры вы будете понимать какие трофеи с боссов лучше для вашего стиля, планировать маршрут, подбирать тринкеты и носить запасные на случай определенных боссов. Кастомизация дилижанса еще больше ослабляет влияние рандома на ран. Например с щенком и 4 предметами на комфорт ваша команда вообще перестанет получать стресс и всегда будет дружить по 15+ независимо от решений. А со змеей даже рандомные хилы колдуна будут стабильно полный столб заливать.
Как рогалик игра крутая, можно собрать веселую имбу типа персонажа который сам себя поджигает, резистит горение, получает за это регенирацию и гарантированный крит на следующий удар и бесконечно хилится и критует.
Самая отстойная часть игры в том, что навыки открываются в святилищах, это прям душно.
Если суммировать, то игра супер веселая когда в ней немного разобрался. Придумывать решения проблем реально интересно, особенно учитывая тот факт, что игра дает тебе все инструменты для этого и никак не ограничивает. Герои супер универсальные и могут выполнять много ролей в отличии от первой части, подклассы еще сильнее расширяют вариативность. Увы, прочитав гайды вы скорее всего пройдете игру часа за 4.

новыми правилами которым нужно привыкнуть первой части тоже нулевой боссов переезжали какой смысл был делать игру тем геймплеем новыми противниками если коротко игре главный совет читать гайды хотя первые несколько траев боссов целом все боссы сложные нужно только понять как убивать как подстраивать под это свою команду креативить менять билды ходу заезда очень весело еще веселее догадываться того как убить босса пройти его самому самый топ это когда время боя сначала огребаешь потом понимаешь что игра тебя хочешь тут придумываешь тактику побеждаешь гайдами так кайфануть целом игра очень хочет чтобы относились своим героям как личностям пушечному мясу первой части для этого есть воспоминания дружба механику игры изменили сделали значительно более предсказуемой есть ваши действия чаще всего идут плану повлиять нельзя буквально десдор маршрут карты середине игры будете понимать какие трофеи боссов лучше для вашего стиля планировать маршрут подбирать тринкеты носить запасные случай определенных боссов кастомизация дилижанса еще больше ослабляет влияние рандома ран например щенком предметами комфорт ваша команда вообще перестанет получать стресс всегда будет дружить независимо решений змеей даже рандомные хилы колдуна будут стабильно полный столб заливать как рогалик игра крутая можно собрать веселую имбу типа персонажа который сам себя поджигает резистит горение получает это регенирацию гарантированный крит следующий удар бесконечно хилится критует самая отстойная часть игры том что навыки открываются святилищах это прям душно если суммировать игра супер веселая когда ней немного разобрался придумывать решения проблем реально интересно особенно учитывая тот факт что игра дает тебе все инструменты для этого никак ограничивает герои супер универсальные могут выполнять много ролей отличии первой части подклассы еще сильнее расширяют вариативность увы прочитав гайды скорее всего пройдете игру часа очень рекомендую попробовать дд2 смотря вонь некоторых

1) I don't have an old PC. I run a Ryzen 7 7700 with 32GB RAM, and a NVIDIA RTX 4060Ti. This game stutters horribly and and struggles to keep up even moderate frames every time it rains or has even a moderate amount of enemies. As the game progresses, this is quite often. More and more I found myself mistiming attacks, dodges, and jumps due to the horrible stutter.

2) I have an XBox controller which works great on even many of the games that don't have full controller support. For some reason, there is one particular LT/RT interaction that doesn't recognize my left trigger pressure. It only detects it as fully up or down. This is a huge problem, because there are many quick-time interactions in this game were this feature is used. While some of them detect it just fine, the interactions at the Prowler stashes never do. So, without fail, every time I have to do one of these stashes, I am forced to disconnect my controller and use the 'Shift' keys, then reattach my controller after each time I need to do this particular LT/RT interaction (sometimes which is multiple times per stash).

Pytanie brzmi: dlaczego? 
No cóż liczyłem na pełną wrażeń opowieść, niczym w Skyrim. Dostałem? Dziwną konwersję Fallouta4. (Nawet niektóre dźwięki  były wyciągnięte prosto z Fallouta) i to najbardziej mnie zabolało. Po wyjściu Starfielda marzyłem o tej grze i kiedy udało mi się ulepszyć sprzęt na tyle ,żeby ta gra spokojnie poszła na najwyższych detalach........ no i marzenie zderzyło się z rzeczywistością. Gra do której (jak mi się wydawało) będę wracał i przerobię w niej lekko 400h................... Sprawiła że po 1 ukończeniu gry w ustach pozostał mi metaliczny smak. Gdybym miał wrócić do Starfielda... to na prawdę musiał bym nie mieć co robić.

Generalnie starfield nie jest złą grą... jest grą która w moim mniemaniu jest za mało dopieszczona w pewnych kwestiach.
Postacie poboczne nie wzbudziły mojej sympatii ,jak działo się to w skyrimie czy F4.
Najważniejsza rzecz która reguluje moje podejście względem gry to jest to czy warto kupić ją za pełną cenę a tutaj [h3] definitywnie nie warto [h3] ,wydając kasę bez promki i to takiej conajmniej 40% to ta gra nie jest warta tych pieniędzy.

pełną wrażeń opowieść niczym skyrim dostałem dziwną konwersję fallouta4 nawet niektóre dźwięki były wyciągnięte prosto fallouta najbardziej mnie zabolało wyjściu starfielda marzyłem tej grze kiedy udało się ulepszyć sprzęt tyle żeby gra spokojnie poszła najwyższych detalach ........ marzenie zderzyło się rzeczywistością gra której jak się wydawało będę wracał przerobię niej lekko 400h ................... sprawiła ukończeniu gry ustach pozostał metaliczny smak gdybym miał wrócić starfielda ... prawdę musiał bym nie mieć robić klasycznie lecimy plusami minusami plusy bardzo fajne bronie ciekawe wraz przyzwoitym systemem dodatków broni gripy celowniki tłumiki generalnie wszelkiej maści hamulce wylotowe etc świetny system budowania statku spędziłem chyba godzin 105 rozegranych żeby dopieścić swoją latającą fortecę spoiler może trochę przesadzam ale pewnością dużo godzin satysfakcjonujących upłynęło przerabianiu poprawianu ulepszaniu statku spoiler pierwsze zderzenie światem starfielda robi przyjemne wrażenie system walki jest okej sensie walki strzelania spoiler mimo czuć nim tak dużo fallouta spoiler główna linia fabularnia jest też porządku mimo braku rewelacji pojawia się kilka ciekawych plottwistów fajne frakcje sensie fajnie wyglądają minusy postacie poboczne .... ależ one obrzydliwie nudne .... leci tak poznajesz postać ona swoje powiedzmy usposobienie wystarczy ciągle dawac opcję dialogową pełną współczucia empatii klepania pleckach sobie nabijamy pozytywną relację system ulepszeń pancerza spoiler kura spoiler ulepszeniem statystyk ... nic się nie zmienia jak fallout przyzwyczaił mnie kiedy daję sobie dodatek pancerza dajmy jedno kilku ulepszeń chociażby kolor tego pancerzyka się zmieniał mimo kolejnych wersji pancerza wszystkie wyglądają tak samo nie ważne czy pancerz poziomu czy spoiler znów fallout przyzwyczaił mnie tego późniejszej części gry dajmy pancerz dostaje nowe elementy jak płytki ochronne albo kolejne części ochrony klatki piersiowej tutaj tego brak ogromny minus który właśnie odbiera urokowi wizualnemu tej gry spoiler moim wypadku gra trafiła kategorii przejdź zapomnij podsumowanie generalnie starfield nie jest złą grą ... jest grą która moim mniemaniu jest mało dopieszczona pewnych kwestiach postacie poboczne nie wzbudziły mojej sympatii jak działo się skyrimie czy najważniejsza rzecz która reguluje moje podejście względem gry jest czy warto kupić pełną cenę tutaj definitywnie nie warto wydając kasę bez promki takiej conajmniej gra nie jest warta tych pieniędzy ale mimo wszystko myślę znajdzie swoją niszę która będzie spędzać niej 400h niestety tej grupy się nie zaliczę mimo wszystko dobra gra którą warto ograć spoiler tyle promocji spoiler,positive,positive,0.34

1716740,"Surprised how much I'm loving the game so far going by the reviews these days 

(Do we really take notice of reviews anymore? I know I don't which has me wondering why I am bothering doing one myself)  

And the comment section... well I'm pretty certain quite a few have mental issues... its just senseless ranting over pixels but others make good points about their criticism. 

I am currently playing a modded version, I haven't tried the vanilla version but I'd have to admit if it wasn't for the mods, quite a lot about the game would have annoyed me, resulting in me uninstalling. 

So far I have 80+ mods to turn the game into a living breathing RPG that requires me to eat/sleep/drink/pay taxes/crew/crew food/fuel/maintenance costs/repair parts and a tonne of other features that adds so much more to the already enormous amount of content.

AI mods have made the enemy excellent and I'm playing on the hardest settings... they are actually slick I have to admit, quite a few of them know how to stage an ambush or hide... other mods have fixed POIs and added more variety etc, so I won't be suffering from copied and pasted encounters.

Without mods I would have down right hated space in this game but with Astrogate that lets me actually travel across a system in my ship with the added bonus of autopilot, ship boarding mods where enemies will close in to board (AWESOME) then with fuel and subsystem mods... I have a fully functioning space ship that I can walk around in, a Cargo bay I can walk around in with or without cargo being present while having to do manual maintenance that require spare parts to complete the repairs, cook food, work on benches or study the system map while in transit or be the pilot myself. 

Everything I dreamt of having the ability to do in Elite Dangerous... not to mention build the ships too... It's  what space fans have always wanted. 

However... they really dropped the ball on space travel and how important a captain can interact with their ship is... I hope  they fix this because mods went far and beyond towards addressing this. 

They could also add in trade routes between planets, possible encounters, radio signals, distress signals, Search and Rescue ,space horror, crew/ship events to deal with... They don't have to be constant every Kilometre throughout travel (That would be awful) but just make it a possibility of happening is enough.  

Maybe new ship combat too that is modelled more towards submarine warfare instead of dog fighting... (Like combat in The Expanse, the dog fighting could be used to fight off a boarding attempt)

If asked to describe the Starfield I'm playing I would say... Imagine The Expanse and For All Mankind mixed with Alien Covenant, planets that would remind you of Riddick and Firefly include hunting (I have it modded where animals are scarce so I have to look for them, they also drop meat which is why I hunt) that reminds me of Jurassic Park... but in the form of Fallout 4 in Space. 

Those thoughts crossed my mind when playing, I just thought to myself its awesome. 

Loading screens... 1-2 secs... 5 seconds when starting the game after logging on... I counted and I continue to count to this day and I think I always will, people are either extremely petty, need to upgrade or the game has been updated to shorten the loading screens because 1-2 seconds is nothing... I forgot all about them. 

(Well when you go to land on planets reminded me, the sudden switch from gameplay to the screen then the landing cutscene... they should include a cutscene of the approach to the planet) 

I'm only 17hrs in, the story and writing is typical Bethesda, it won't win awards for cinematic's and the writing will get the point across before unleashing you into the sandbox to proceed how you like... I think its ok, I'm enjoying it. My focus in the game is making money so I can get a crew so we can put a team together to then capture bounties, put them in a brig and send them to prison... I'm a long way away from that but its my goal all the missions and story content is just a bonus waiting for me to try when I'm ready. 

Would I recommend it... with mods absolutely... (A list of mods should be suggested to install for the best experience)  I'm loving it at the moment but as I write this, aside from fast travelling everywhere, I have no idea what people do between getting to and from missions... they're missing out in so much.

1716740,"I haven't seen this big of a disappointment since my son. I even knew I was in for a disappointing ride, but holy mother of shit this one's bad!

Starfield is a game that has an extremely wide reach, with the depth of a puddle. I don't even know where to start complaining about this pile of garbage. You can't fly your ship around the planet, you just land it in a fixed spot in a procedurally generated wasteland that might have some things you can footslog to, look at and maaaaybe even shoot at. Maybe. Space flight is a waste of time too, you don't actually get to move around the planet or system you're in. You're basically flying in a big empty box that might have space pirates in it. You can't land on the planet you're visiting, you do it all through fast travel menus. Sometimes you'll find an asteroid field. Crash your ship into one of them and see what happens (Spoiler alert: NOTHING!). This game is fucking stupid, designed by stupid people. Seriously wasted potential here.

Crowds are basically the same 20 npcs copypasted over and over again that have no dialogue aside from ""hi"" or ""hello."" Remember how Skyrim's cities, almost all of the NPCs had names and were all involved in at least one quest or relevant to a story somehow? Not anymore, those days are long dead and over. You get generic NPC slop now. Enjoy it!

I bought this for the star wars genesis mod and I'd argue that doesn't save it or justify the price I paid (Even at 40% off). Maybe it'll be good in five or ten years, who knows.
